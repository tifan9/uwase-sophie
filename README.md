# Sophie Uwase Portfolio Design

Portfolio website for Sophie Uwase, built with React and Vite.

## Running the code

Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.

Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.

## Building for Production

Run `npm run build` to create a production build. The output will be in the `build` directory.

## Deployment to Netlify

This project is configured for deployment on Netlify:

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify
2. Use the following build settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `build`
3. The `netlify.toml` file in this repository contains the necessary configuration for proper deployment

Note: This is a Vite project, not a Next.js project, so the Next.js plugin is explicitly disabled in the configuration.
